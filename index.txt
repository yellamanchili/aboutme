 am a new member of the spring batch working on my Masters in Applied Computer Science and would graduate in 2020

I am from Vijayawada, India where I graduated as an engineer with computer science as my major from Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation. I usually like to hang out in coffee shops with my friends and love video games like FIFA .

I hope to find a job as a software engineer after my graduation. Becoming a Software Developer seems to the plan for now but may change over time.
Football(what Americans call soccer) is my favourite sport. It is just a joy to watch MAnchester United play the game with such entusiasm and they just cheer the crowd. Cristiano Ronaldo is the greatest player of all time who has broken almost every record there is to be broken.
